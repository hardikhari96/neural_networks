### Simple Neural Network Layer Example

This project demonstrates a basic concept in deep learning: computing the output of a single neural network layer with three neurons. Each neuron has its own set of weights and biases, and they process the same input data.



## Code Overview

- **Inputs**: The fixed input values for the neural network.
- **Weights and Biases**: Each neuron has a unique set of weights and a bias.
- **Output Calculation**: The output for each neuron is computed as the weighted sum of inputs plus the bias.
